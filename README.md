## How to Use
Each of the 40 files are designed to be standalone and can be run independently.
However some files have table names that are actually created using some previous files queries, So it is highly recommended to go through the files in a sequential manner to gain better understanding and avoid some errors. You can run these SQL scripts in MySQL Workbench or any MySQL-compatible client.

- Simply clone the repository and navigate to the `.sql` file corresponding to the topic you're interested in.
- You can also explore the comments in each SQL file to better understand the queries and concepts used.

For example, if you're interested in learning about `xyz-topic`, navigate to the `xyz-topic.sql` file and run the queries step by step to see how each type of join works.
